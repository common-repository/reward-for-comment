= What is it for ? =

Everybody like unique content, and the text of comments of your users is very important source of it, second only to the posts/pages.
This plugin gives you ability to motivate the users to comment more with tiny expenses.

= How does it work ? =
Satoshi is small fraction of the Bitcoin. 
You select the amount the comment deserves, and satoshi move from your account to account of the commenter. 
That's it.  

= Do the users have to provide the Bitcoin address to get paid ? = 
Nope. The payment is going to be send to the Cryptoo.me account associated with the user's email. 
If the user does not have account with Cryptoo.me yet, he/she can register with this email, and access the funds. 

= How long does it take for the satoshi to change hands ? =
Payment happens instantaneously. So be careful when you select the amount, you can not "un-send" the funds.

= Who pays the Bitcoin commission ? =

Nobody does. The crypto-currency transaction happens via micro-payment system, so it is free.
